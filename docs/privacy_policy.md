# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** Jan 14, 2025

Thank you for using OpenSpool! Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our software.

## Data Collection
OpenSpool does not collect, store, or process any personal data or identifiable information from its users. The software operates entirely on your device and does not transmit data to external servers or third-party services.

## Data Usage
Since we do not collect or store any data, there is no user data to use, analyze, or share.

## Third-Party Services
If the software integrates with third-party services (e.g., APIs or plugins), any data handled by those services is subject to their respective privacy policies. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party services you choose to use with OpenSpool.

## Open Source Nature
OpenSpool is open source, meaning its source code is publicly available and can be reviewed, modified, or contributed to by anyone. This transparency ensures that you can verify how the software operates and confirm that it does not collect or store data.

## User Responsibility
As an open-source project, OpenSpool provides tools that run locally on your device. You are responsible for maintaining the security and privacy of your device and any data you choose to process with the software.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the software or legal requirements. Any updates will be clearly posted in the project's repository or official website.
